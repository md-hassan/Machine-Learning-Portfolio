### Neural_Networks_From_Scratch.ipynb:
Implementation of a Neural Network using numpy over the MNIST dataset.
<br>With help of Michael Nielsen's excellent online book [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/index.html).
<br> Achieved an accuracy of 95.09%.

### Neural_Networks_From_Scratch(Vectorized).ipynb:
My implementation of a fully matrix-based approach to the same problem as above.
<br> Achieved an accuracy of 94.48%.*

### mnist.pkl.gz:
Pickled form of the MNIST datset.

### mnist_loader.py:
A library to load the MNIST datset.


(*Note that results may vary slightly due to random initialization of weights and biases.)
