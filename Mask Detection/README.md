## Mask Detection

#### This is a Mask Detection model I made using Keras. The model architecture is a simple Convolutional Neural Network with two hidden layers, with which I was able to achieve 98.66% accuracy.

#### I used a Haar Cascade to detect faces and then predicted on top of that, displaying the result on a  Live Feed using OpenCV.
